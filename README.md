## ðŸŽ® How to Play

* Each player chooses a number from **1 to 9** representing a cell in the grid:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

* Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
* After each turn, the board is updated.
* The game ends when:

  * A player wins by placing three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
  * All spaces are filled without a winner (tie).

  * Win conditions in 8 possible ways (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals)
  * Tie if all positions are filled with no winner
* Invalid moves (out-of-range or taken cells) are handled.
